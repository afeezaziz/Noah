Of course. This is a visionary concept that combines a secure desktop wallet, a sophisticated trading bot, and an AI-native interface into a single, powerful application. Crafting the PRD for "Noah" requires a clear vision that balances this immense power with user security and simplicity.

Here is an extensive Product Requirement Document for **Noah**, designed for the development team.

## **Product Requirement Document: Noah - The Autonomous Financial Agent**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 26, 2023  
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Author:** Product Team

### **1. Introduction & Vision**

#### 1.1. Product Vision
Noah will be the first **AI-native, autonomous financial agent** for the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. It will be a secure, desktop-based application that combines a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet with a powerful, extensible trading engine and a Large Language Model (LLM) "brain." Noah will empower users to not only manage their assets on the Ark L2 but to deploy sophisticated, open-source trading and liquidity-providing strategies, analyze market data through natural language, and participate in the emerging Bitcoin economy in a way that was never before possible.

#### 1.2. Key Personas / User Profiles
*   **"The Delegator":** A crypto-savvy user who wants to earn yield but lacks the time or expertise to trade actively. They want to browse a marketplace of vetted, open-source strategies, allocate a portion of their capital to them, and monitor the performance.
*   **"The Quant":** A technical user, trader, or developer who wants to write and backtest their own trading strategies in a secure environment. They are the primary creator of the open-source strategies.
*   **"The Analyst":** A trader who wants to use the power of an LLM to digest market data, identify opportunities, and get insights through natural language. They may execute trades manually based on the AI's analysis.

### **2. System Architecture & Tech Stack**

Noah will be a cross-platform desktop application designed with a strict separation between the secure wallet core and the flexible logic engine.

| Component | Technology | Role & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Application Shell** | **Tauri (Rust)** | Provides a secure, lightweight, and cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) application shell. The Rust backend is the **security-critical core**, responsible for all cryptographic operations and interactions with the operating system. |
| **Frontend UI** | **React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS** | A modern, high-performance web-based UI running inside the Tauri webview. This allows for rapid development and a rich user experience. |
| **Core Logic Engine**| **Python 3.10+** | The "brains" of the operation. The Rust backend will spawn and manage a sandboxed Python process. Python is chosen for its world-class ecosystem for data analysis (`pandas`), trading, and AI/LLM integration (`LangChain`, `Hugging Face`). |
| **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** | **Local REST API or Stdio**| The Rust backend will communicate with the Python engine via a secure, local-only interface. This creates a strong security boundary: the untrusted, flexible Python world can *request* actions, but the trusted Rust core must *approve and execute* all sensitive operations (like signing transactions). |
| **AI/LLM Brain** | **LangChain / OpenAI API / Local LLM (Ollama)** | The LLM integration will be managed by the Python engine. This allows for flexibility in choosing between powerful cloud-based models or private, local models. |
| **Local Datastore**| **PostgreSQL or SQLite** | A local database managed by the Python engine to store historical market data, trade logs, and backtesting results. |

### **3. Core Features & Requirements (FR)**

#### FR1: Wallet Core (The Secure Foundation)
*   **FR1.1: Secure Key Management:**
    *   The **Tauri/Rust** backend MUST be solely responsible for generating, importing (BIP39), storing (encrypted with a user password), and using private keys.
    *   The Python engine can *request* a signature for a transaction, but the Rust core MUST present a final confirmation prompt to the user in the native UI before signing. **The private keys never leave the Rust sandbox.**
*   **FR1.2: Multi-Asset Support:** The wallet must be able to derive addresses for and display balances of `BTC-VTXO` and any Taproot Asset VTXO on the Ark L2.
*   **FR1.3: Connection Management:** The wallet must securely manage API connections and keys for the Ark Operator's gateways and any third-party Matchmaker or exchange APIs.

#### FR2: Data Digestion Engine (The "Senses")
This is a background service within the Python engine responsible for collecting market intelligence.
*   **FR2.1: Multi-Source Ingestion:** It MUST connect to and ingest real-time data from:
    *   The **Ark MCP Gateway** via WebSocket or frequent polling for L2 state.
    *   The **Ark Coordinator Service** for fee and queue data.
    *   **External Exchange APIs** (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) for L1 price feeds.
    *   **Nostr Relays** for decentralized signaling, community strategy updates, or news feeds.
*   **FR2.2: Local Time-Series Database:** All ingested data must be stored in a local, high-performance database, optimized for time-series analysis and backtesting.

#### FR3: Strategy Engine (The "Hands")
This is the heart of the agent's logic, designed as an open, plug-in based system.
*   **FR3.1: Open Source Strategy Framework:**
    *   A strategy MUST be a Python class that inherits from a standard `BaseStrategy`.
    *   The base class will define methods that the engine calls, such as `on_tick(market_data)`, `on_order_fill(fill_data)`, and `execute()`.
*   **FR3.2: Strategy Lifecycle Management:** The UI must allow users to:
    *   **Load** strategies from a local file or a public Git repository.
    *   **Configure** strategy parameters (e.g., capital allocation, risk limits).
    *   **Activate** and **Deactivate** strategies with a single click.
*   **FR3.3: Backtesting Engine:** Noah must provide a robust backtesting environment that runs a strategy against the historical data stored in the local database and generates a detailed performance report (PnL, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, etc.).

#### FR4: Execution Engine
This module translates signals from the Strategy Engine into actionable transactions.
*   **FR4.1: Intent Construction:** When a strategy decides to act, this engine constructs the partial or full Ark intent.
*   **FR4.2: Request Signing:** It sends the final transaction details to the **Tauri/Rust core** via IPC with a request for a user-approved signature.
*   **FR4.3: Submission:** Once signed, it submits the intent to the appropriate Matchmaker API or Gateway endpoint.
*   **FR4.4: Position Tracking:** It monitors the MCP for settlement and updates the agent's internal portfolio manager.

#### FR5: The LLM Brain (The "Navigator")
The LLM integration provides the natural language interface to the entire system.
*   **FR5.1: Natural Language Querying (Analyst Mode):** The user can ask questions in a chat-like interface.
    *   *"What was the average funding rate for the BTC perp on ArkSwap in the last 24 hours?"*
    *   *"Show me all arbitrage opportunities between ArkSwap and Binance greater than 0.1% right now."*
    *   **Logic:** The Python engine uses LangChain to convert the user's query into API calls to the Data Digestion Engine, formats the results, and returns a human-readable answer.
*   **FR5.2: Strategy Co-Pilot:** The LLM can help users build and refine strategies.
    *   *"Generate a simple market-making strategy in Python for the tUSD/BTC pool."*
    *   *"Analyze my backtest results and suggest improvements to the risk parameters."*
*   **FR5.3: Autonomous Operation (Expert Mode):** An advanced feature where the user can give the LLM high-level goals.
    *   *"Monitor the market and execute any arbitrage trade with an expected profit of over 5,000 sats, using a maximum of 0.1 BTC per trade. Ask for confirmation before each trade."*

#### FR6: The User Interface (The Cockpit)
*   **Screen: Main Dashboard:** A high-level overview of total portfolio value, PnL for active strategies, and key market indicators.
*   **Screen: Wallet:** A standard interface for sending and receiving assets, showing balances and transaction history.
*   **Screen: Strategy Marketplace:** A UI for browsing, importing, and managing open-source strategies. Displays backtest results and community risk scores.
*   **Screen: Strategy Studio:** A simple code editor and backtesting interface for "Quant" users.
*   **Screen: Noah Terminal:** The chat interface for interacting with the LLM Brain.

### **4. Development To-Do List (High-Level)**

| # | Task | Category | Description |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Setup the Tauri + Python Bridge** | **Architecture** | This is the first and most critical technical hurdle. Establish a secure and reliable IPC mechanism between the Rust backend and a managed Python process. |
| **2** | **Implement the Secure Wallet Core**| **Security** | Build the key generation, storage, and signing logic entirely within the Rust backend. Expose a minimal, secure API to the Python engine. |
| **3** | **Build the Data Digestion Engine**| **Backend** | Develop the Python services to connect to all required data sources (MCP, Exchanges, Nostr) and populate the local database. |
| **4** | **Design the `BaseStrategy` API** | **Backend** | Create the standardized Python class that all open-source strategies will inherit from. This defines the core event loop (`on_tick`, etc.). |
| **5** | **Build the Execution Engine** | **Backend** | Write the code that takes a signal from a strategy, constructs a valid Ark intent, gets it signed by the Rust core, and submits it. |
| **6** | **Develop the Frontend UI** | **Frontend** | Build all the React components and pages described in the feature list. |
| **7** | **Integrate the LLM (Level 1)** | **AI** | Implement the "Analyst Mode" first. This involves setting up LangChain (or a similar library) to convert natural language questions into queries against the local database. |
| **8** | **Launch the Open Source Strategy Repo**| **Community** | Create a public GitHub repository with examples and documentation for how developers can create and submit their own strategies. |
| **9** | **Package & Release** | **Deployment** | Create the final, signed desktop application installers for macOS, Windows, and Linux using Tauri's build tools. |
