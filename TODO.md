### **Project To-Do List: Noah - The Autonomous Financial Agent**

**Objective:** To develop, test, and deploy a secure, cross-platform desktop application that combines a non-custodial Ark L2 wallet with an AI-powered, open-source trading engine.

**Target Tech Stack:** Tauri (Rust), React (TypeScript, Vite), Python, PostgreSQL/SQLite, LangChain.

| # | Task | Category | Detailed Steps & Requirements | Acceptance Criteria |
| :-- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Secure Foundation & Core Architecture** |
| 1.1 | **Initialize the Tauri Project** | **Setup** | 1.  Set up a new Tauri project with a React TypeScript template. <br/> 2.  Establish the project structure, creating separate directories for the Rust backend (`src-tauri`), the React frontend (`src`), and the Python core logic engine (`src-python`). <br/> 3.  Initialize a Git repository. | A blank Tauri application window with a "Hello World" React component successfully builds and runs on the developer's local machine. |
| 1.2 | **Implement the Rust/Python Bridge** | **Architecture** | 1.  In the Rust backend (`src-tauri/src/main.rs`), write the logic to spawn the Python engine as a sidecar process on app startup. <br/> 2.  Establish a secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) channel. A local-only REST API (using a library like `axum` in Rust and `FastAPI` in Python) is a robust choice. The Rust backend will manage the port and a secret auth token. <br/> 3.  Create a simple "ping/pong" command to verify that the Rust and Python processes can communicate. | The Rust backend successfully starts the Python process. The Python process can make a REST call to the Rust backend, and vice-versa, with a shared secret for authentication. |
| 1.3 | **Implement Secure Key Management (Rust Core)** | **Security** | 1.  In the Rust backend, add Rust crates for Bitcoin cryptography (`bip39`, `bitcoin`, `secp256k1`). <br/> 2.  Implement functions for: `generate_new_seed`, `import_from_seed`, `derive_private_key_for_path`. <br/> 3.  Implement functions to encrypt the seed phrase with a user-provided password using a strong KDF (like Argon2) and AES-256-GCM. <br/> 4.  Store the encrypted seed in Tauri's secure, isolated application storage. **Private keys must never be written to disk unencrypted.** | The Rust core can create, import, encrypt, and decrypt a BIP39 mnemonic. A user's password is required to access the decrypted seed in memory. |
| 1.4 | **Create the Signing Oracle (Rust Core)** | **Security** | 1.  Expose a **single, secure IPC endpoint** from Rust: `POST /sign_transaction`. <br/> 2.  This endpoint accepts the details of an unsigned transaction (e.g., inputs to spend, outputs to create). <br/> 3.  When this endpoint is called, the Rust backend must **trigger a native OS confirmation dialog** (using Tauri's `dialog` API) that clearly displays the full transaction details to the user. <br/> 4.  Only if the user clicks "Confirm" in this native dialog will the Rust core proceed to sign the transaction and return the signature. The Python engine cannot bypass this step. | The Python engine can request a signature, but the user is always presented with a native confirmation prompt before any cryptographic signing occurs. |
| **Phase 2: Data Ingestion & Wallet Functionality** |
| 2.1 | **Develop the Data Digestion Engine (Python)** | **Backend** | 1.  Create a `DataIngestor` class in the Python engine. <br/> 2.  Implement methods to connect to the required data sources (Ark MCP, Coordinator API, external exchange APIs) via REST and WebSockets using `httpx` and `websockets`. <br/> 3.  Implement a background task that continuously polls/listens to these sources. <br/> 4.  Set up the local PostgreSQL/SQLite database schema for storing time-series market data. <br/> 5.  The `DataIngestor` must parse incoming data and write it to the local database. | The Python engine can successfully connect to all data sources, ingest real-time data, and store it in the local database. |
| 2.2 | **Build the Core Wallet UI (React)**| **Frontend** | 1.  Build the React components for the full onboarding flow (Welcome, Create Seed, Confirm, Password). These components will call the Rust backend via Tauri's IPC for all cryptographic actions. <br/> 2.  Build the main dashboard UI components (`BalanceCard`, `AssetList`, `TransactionHistory`, etc.). <br/> 3.  Build the standard "Send" and "Receive" screens. | A user can create a new wallet, see their dashboard, and view their (initially empty) balances and transaction history. |
| 2.3 | **Implement Wallet State Synchronization**| **Integration**| 1.  The React frontend will fetch all wallet state (balances, VTXOs, history) by calling the **Python engine's** API. <br/> 2.  The Python engine's API will, in turn, fetch this data from the **Ark MCP Gateway**. This keeps the frontend simple and centralizes data logic in Python. <br/> 3.  Implement the full logic for the "Send" flow: the frontend constructs the transaction details and sends them to the Python engine, which then requests a signature from the Rust core. | The wallet displays the correct VTXO balances and transaction history for the user's Ark address. A user can successfully construct and sign a standard VTXO transfer. |
| **Phase 3: Strategy & Execution Engine** |
| 3.1 | **Design the `BaseStrategy` API (Python)** | **Architecture**| 1.  In the Python engine, create an abstract base class `BaseStrategy`. <br/> 2.  Define the required methods and properties: `name`, `author`, `description`, `parameters`, `on_tick(data)`, `on_order_fill(fill)`. <br/> 3.  Implement a simple example strategy (e.g., a basic moving average crossover) that inherits from this base class. | A developer can create a new Python file with a class that inherits from `BaseStrategy`, and the engine can dynamically load and validate it. |
| 3.2 | **Build the Strategy Marketplace UI (React)** | **Frontend** | 1.  Create the "Strategy Marketplace" screen. <br/> 2.  Implement UI for loading a strategy from a local file or a Git URL. <br/> 3.  Create a "Strategy Card" component that displays the strategy's name, author, description, and an "Activate" toggle. <br/> 4.  Build a configuration modal that allows users to set the capital allocation and risk parameters for each strategy. | A user can import the example strategy, allocate capital to it, and activate/deactivate it from the UI. |
| 3.3 | **Develop the Backtesting Engine (Python)**| **Backend** | 1.  Create a `Backtester` class in the Python engine. <br/> 2.  This class takes a strategy and a time range as input. <br/> 3.  It reads the historical market data from the local database and feeds it, tick by tick, into the strategy's `on_tick` method. <br/> 4.  It simulates order execution and generates a detailed performance report (PnL, etc.). | A user can select a strategy in the "Strategy Studio" screen, run a backtest, and view a performance report in the UI. |
| 3.4 | **Develop the Execution Engine (Python)**| **Backend** | 1.  Create an `ExecutionEngine` class. <br/> 2.  When an active strategy generates a trade signal, this engine is responsible for: <br/>    a. Checking against the user's risk parameters. <br/>    b. Constructing the final Ark intent. <br/>    c. Sending the intent to the Rust core for signing. <br/>    d. Submitting the signed intent to the correct Matchmaker/Gateway. | When the example strategy is run in "live" mode, it correctly generates signals, and the Execution Engine successfully requests a signature from the Rust core for a real transaction. |
| **Phase 4: AI Integration & Final Polish** |
| 4.1 | **Implement the LLM Brain (Analyst Mode)** | **AI/Backend**| 1.  Integrate LangChain into the Python engine. <br/> 2.  Create a "LangChain agent" that is given "tools." These tools are functions that can query the local time-series database (e.g., `get_price_data`, `get_funding_rates`). <br/> 3.  Expose an IPC endpoint from the Python engine that accepts a natural language query string. | A user can type a question like "What was the price of tUSD yesterday?" into the "Noah Terminal" UI, and the Python engine uses the LLM to understand the question, query its local DB, and return a correct, human-readable answer. |
| 4.2 | **Build the Noah Terminal UI (React)**| **Frontend** | Create the chat-like interface for the LLM brain. It should display queries, responses, and potentially charts or data tables returned by the LLM. | The full user-to-LLM-to-data-and-back loop is functional. |
| 4.3 | **Write Comprehensive Documentation**| **Docs** | 1.  Write a `USER_GUIDE.md` explaining how to use the wallet and its features. <br/> 2.  Write a `STRATEGY_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` explaining the `BaseStrategy` API and how to create, test, and submit open-source strategies. |
| 4.4 | **Package & Release** | **Deployment**| 1.  Configure the `tauri.conf.json` for all three target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). <br/> 2.  Set up code signing for the application to avoid OS warnings. <br/> 3.  Create the final application installers and prepare for public release. | The application is successfully built, signed, and packaged for all target operating systems. |
